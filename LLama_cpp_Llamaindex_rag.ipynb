Keep children at a safe distance from the stove while heating \\nproducts, especially during and after the boiling phase. \\nAbout Jams, Jellies and Preserves \\nThe less sugar you use the greater the flavor impact of the fruit. If honey is \\nused there will be a flavor change and the jellies/jams must be cooked longer. If \\nyou use artificial sweeteners use only the Cyclamate type to avoid bitterness and \\nfollow the manufacturer\\'s instructions. Cooked down jellies in which the juice is \\nextracted by the open kettle method contain 60% fruit versus commercial \\nproducts [pressure cooked to extract more juice but pectin destroying] with only \\n45% Jelly: has great clarity from dripping the cooked fruit through a cloth before \\nadding sugar and finishing.\\nJams, Butter and Pastes: are whole fruit purees of increasing density.\\nMarmalades, Preserves and Conserves: are bits of fruit in a heavy syrup.\\nHigh Pectin Fruits: Apples, Crabapples, Quinces, Red Currants, \\nGooseberries, Plums and Cranberries. These need no additional pectin.\\nIf you get syrupy jelly you used too much sugar or did not cook the juice \\nlong enough after adding the sugar.\\nLow Pectin Fruits: Strawberries, Blueberries, Peaches, Apricots, Cherries, \\nPears, Blackberries, Raspberries, Grapes, Pineapple and Rhubarb. These require \\ncombining with high pectin fruits or adding a commercial pectin.\\nTo Test Pectin Content: Put 1 tbl cooled fruit juice in a glass. Add an equal \\namount of grain alcohol and shake gently. The alcohol will bring the pectin \\ntogether in a gel. If a large amount of pectin is present it will appear in a single \\nmass or clot when poured from the glass. Use equal amounts of juice and sugar. If \\nthe pectin collects in several small particles use have as much sugar as juice.\\n\\nHomemade Jam Recipes\\n4To sterilize jelly glasses: first, ensure there are no chips or cracks in your \\njars. Fill jars 3/4 full of water and place them in a shallow pan partly filled with \\nwater. Simmer 15 min and then keep hot until filled. If the lids are placed on the \\nsteaming jars they will be sterilized simultaneously.\\nTips: Use enamel or stainless steel pots not aluminum or copper.\\n-On average, use 3/4 c sugar to 1 c fruit or juice depending on pectin \\ncontent [see above].\\n-Very acid fruits can tolerate a whole c of sugar.\\n-Sterilize jars and seal tightly.\\n-For fruit that tends to discolor add lemon juice or Ascorbic acid.\\n-Keep in a cool dark place but do not refrigerate.\\nMaking Jam: is easiest and most economical as it needs only one cooking \\nstep and uses the pulp. Measure the fruit. In putting it in the pan, crush the lower \\nlayers to provide moisture until more is drawn out by cooking or add a little \\nwater. Simmer the fruit until it is soft. Add sugar and stir until dissolved. Bring to \\na boil, stirring to avoid sticking. Reduce heat and cook until thickened-up to 1/2 \\nhour.\\nMaking Preserves and Conserves: Place fruit in a pot with an equal amount \\nof sugar in layers ending with sugar on top and allow to rest overnight. Bring \\nslowly to a boil and simmer until fruit is translucent. Drain fruit and put in sterile \\njars. Simmer syrup longer if necessary to thicken it and pour over fruit. Seal and \\nstore.\\nMaking juice for jelly: Wash and drain fruit. Prick or crush the fruit. Add \\nwater if fruit is not juicy enough eg. apples. Add enough to the kettle that you can \\nsee it through the fruit but the fruit is not floating. Cook uncovered until the fruit \\nis soft and loosing its color. Have ready a jelly bag [several layers of cheese cloth.] \\nWet it, wring it out and line a strainer with it. Let the juice drip through without \\nsqueezing it as this muddies and flavors the jelly.\\nThis juice can be kept up to 6 months before proceeding by freezing or \\ncanning it.\\n\\nwww.obooko.com\\n5Making jelly: Measure the strained juice and put it in an enamel or \\nstainless steel pan. Simmer 5 min. Skim off froth. Measure and warm sugar in a \\npan in the oven and add it. Stir until dissolved. Cook at a gentle simmer until the \\npoint of jelling. To test, place a small amount of jelly on a spoon, cool it slightly \\nand let it drop back into the pot from the side of the spoon. As the syrup thickens, \\n2 large drops will form along the edge of the spoon. when these two drops run \\ntogether and fall as a single drop the \"sheeting\" stage has been reached-220 to \\n222 deg F and the jelly will be firm when cooled. It can take anywhere from 10 to \\n30 min for jelly to reach this stage depending on the fruit and the amount of \\nsugar. Take the jars from the sterilizing bath and invert on a cake cooler. They \\nshould be hot but dry when filled. Fill to 1/4\" from the top. Cover with melted \\nparaffin 1/8\" deep.\\nMeasuring\\nThe majority of recipes in the book use U.S. measures, so here’s a link to useful \\nconversion charts if you prefer using imperial or metric measures: \\nhttps://whatscookingamerica.net/equiv.htm\\n\\nHomemade Jam Recipes\\n6Ambrosial Jam\\n8 peaches, peeled\\n3 large oranges\\n1 pulp of 1 med. cantaloupe\\n1 lemon\\n1 (8 1/2 oz.) can crushed\\n1 pineapple\\n1 sugar\\nChop all ingredients fine.

However, in the recent years, improvement has been seen in this area. With the rapid increase in the number of vehicles on the road, the traffic conditions are under a lot of pressure. Therefore, road safety is one of the most serious public health issues in our country. It has an impact on everyone, whether one drives a vehicle, walks or rides a cycle. \\nFig. 4.1: Road accident\\nUnit 4.indd   98 3/11/2021   12:02:51 PM\\n\\n\\nRoad Safety99Understanding Road Safety  \\nRoad safety refers to the measures which must be \\nadopted by everyone while using roads. These safety methods are meant for reducing the risk of accidents and injuries or causalities on the road. These rules must be followed by all users of roads including pedestrians, cyclists, motorists, and bus and truck drivers. Safety methods also relate to the construction, layout of roads as well as traffic regulation systems. So, we can summarise that road safety involves:\\n (i) the design of roads and highways;\\n (ii) laws pertaining to traffic and vehicles;\\n (iii) systems of traffic safety and control; \\n (iv) driver education; \\n (v) school students’ education; \\n (vi) mass education; \\n (vii) traffic regulation and road safety signs; \\n (viii) vehicle design; and \\n (ix) motor vehicle safety inspection and maintenance. \\nKeeping our roads safe is not that difficult a task. Imagine if everyone follows simple safety measures and traffic rules, there will be no accident!\\nIn this Unit, you will understand the various types of \\nroad safety measures to be adopted, and the importance of safety rules, road signs, traffic signals and rules, driving rules, registration and licensing adopted in  \\nour country.\\nSeSSIon 1: I mportance  of road Safety\\nRoad Safety \\nSome of the major causes of road accidents are as follows.\\n (i) Lack of highway safety\\n (ii) Drunken driving \\n (iii) Driving in an exhausted state for long hours \\n (iv) Using cell phone while driving\\n (v) Overspeeding or rash driving\\nUnit 4.indd   99 05-Mar-19   3:15:44 PM\\n\\n\\nAutomotive  Service  technici An – clASS iX100 (vi) Driving in wrong lanes\\n (vii) Turning without giving signal\\n (viii) Overtaking from wrong side\\nIt can be seen that road safety is a collective responsibility. \\nTherefore each one of us has to take steps required  \\nof us.\\nRole of Government and Public Sector\\n (i) Develop stricter road safety polices\\n (ii) Generate funds for road safety awareness\\n (iii) Stricter enforcement of rules by government\\n (iv) Building better roads and highways\\nRole of General Community\\n (i) Acceptance of road safety rules, regulations and \\npolicies\\n (ii) Participation in road safety awareness drives to \\nenhance people’s  knowledge about road safety\\nRole of Education Sector\\n (i) Inclusion of road safety modules in  \\nschool curriculum\\n (ii) Impart road safety education with the help of \\nexperts in this area\\n (iii) Impart effective driver training for learners as well \\nas existing drivers\\nRole of Media \\n (i) Communicate road safety messages through print \\nand electronic media\\n (ii) Support road safety initiatives through responsible \\nand objective reporting\\nRole of Health Professionals\\n (i) Strengthen trauma facilities in our country.\\n (ii) Organise workshops for saving the lives of people \\nin road accidents.\\nUnit 4.indd   100 05-Mar-19   3:15:44 PM\\n\\n\\nRoad Safety101Improvement in Infrastructure \\n (i) Adopt effective and safe traffic management \\nmeasures while planning and designing \\ninfrastructure.

In addition to the human suffering, the estimated cost of road injuries is a noticeable amount in Gross National Product (GNP) per annum. \\nUnit 4.indd   101 05-Mar-19   3:15:44 PM\\n\\n\\nAutomotive  Service  technici An – clASS iX102A few important road safety tips are mentioned below. \\n (i) Do not use your mobile phone while driving.\\n (ii) Use seatbelts even while sitting at the back seat of \\nthe vehicle.\\n (iii) Do not drink and drive.\\n (iv) Always adhere to the speed limit.\\n (v) Take special care with regard to children, senior \\ncitizens and pedestrians. \\n (vi) Do not drive if tired.\\n (vii) Pedestrians should walk cautiously and make use \\nof zebra crossing.\\n (viii) Stay alert and observant while driving.\\n (ix) Keep distance from other vehicles while driving. \\n (x) Always wear helmets and seatbelts.\\nSafety Devices\\nTwo-wheeler Helmet\\nA two-wheeler helmet (Figs 4.2, 4.3) is a type of protective \\nheadgear used by bicycle, motorcycle and scooter riders. The primary goal- of a two-wheeler helmet is to protect the rider’s head during impact, thus preventing or reducing head injury or saving the rider’s life. Some helmets provide additional conveniences, such as ventilation, face shields, ear protection, etc. \\nOf all the organs in our body, the heart and brain \\nare the most vital ones. When a two-wheeler rider meets with an accident, it is the brain that is at a greater risk of injury. A brain injury can result due to skull fracture, \\nFig. 4.2: Bicycle helmet\\n Fig. 4.3: Two-wheeler helmet\\nUnit 4.indd   102 05-Mar-19   3:15:44 PM\\n\\n\\nRoad Safety103Practical Exercisesa concussion, brain  haemorrhage, which can result  \\nin death.\\nEven if a part of the brain is damaged, it might result \\nin the loss of speech or motor skills. In order to protect \\nthe brain, one must wear a helmet. A motorcycle helmet protects the skull and the brain from extensive damage.\\nAirbag\\nAn airbag (see Unit 3, Fig. 3.40) is fitted in a four-wheeler to protect the driver and passengers during an accident. \\n \\nActivity 1\\nList the safety rules which must be followed on road.\\nS.

Do not drive if you\\n (i) have been drinking alcohol.\\n (ii) take any medicine or drug that affects your \\nresponses.\\n (iii) are tired, as it affects your driving skills and \\nreaction time.\\n (iv) are sick or injured.  \\n (v) are angry or upset.  \\nIn such conditions, you could be risking your life or lives of others on the road.\\nKnow Your Vehicle \\nGo through the vehicle owner’s manual.  \\nYou should know the features of the vehicle you \\nare going to drive, for example, anti-lock brakes,  \\nfour-wheel drive, etc.  \\nUnit 4.indd   105 05-Mar-19   3:15:44 PM\\n\\n\\nAutomotive  Service  technici An – clASS iX106\\nFig. 4.6: Sitting positionEnsure that you know where the controls and \\ninstruments are and what they do. Check that all \\nemergency signals and instruments work.\\nYou should be able to turn on wipers, washers, \\nheadlights, indicators, etc., without having to look at them and without taking your eyes off the road. \\nSeating Position \\nProper, upright position gives more stability while driving. Make sure you can see over the steering wheel and hood. You should be able to see the ground 1.5–2.0 \\nmetre in front of the vehicle for proper judgement.   \\nSit straight and upright in the \\nseat, with your elbows slightly bent. Adjust the seat (Fig. 4.6) so that your feet reach the pedals easily. Place your feet flat on the floor under the brake pedal. You are seated properly if you can do this.\\nAdjust the headrest to an \\nappropriate height. It protects the head in case of collision.\\nCars with air bags:  It is important \\nto note that an air bag cannot prevent \\ninjuries if the seating posi tion \\nis incorrect. \\nKnow Your Blind Spots \\nBlind spot (Fig. 4.7) is an area on each side of the vehicle that you cannot see through the mirrors. Mostly blind \\nspots are to the back left and back right of the vehicle. In Fig. 4.7, the red car is in the blind spot area of the silver car. The green areas show the blind spots of the  \\nsilver car. \\nAdjust the mirrors to get \\nthe maximum view and identify your blind spots. You may not see vehicles when they are in  \\nthese spots.\\nFig. 4.7: Know your blind spots\\nUnit 4.indd   106 05-Mar-19   3:15:45 PM\\n\\n\\nRoad Safety107Position the interior mirror so that the centre of the \\nmirror shows the centre of the rear window. When the \\ninterior mirror is properly adjusted, you would be able \\nto see directly behind your vehicle (Fig. 4.8).   \\nThe exterior (wing) mirror adjustment \\nshould be made while seated normally for driving. Do not set the right-hand exterior mirror by placing your head against the glass of the driver’s door window. Do not adjust the left-hand exterior mirror by leaning to the centre of the vehicle. \\nSide mirrors show only narrow angles \\nof view, so you have to turn your head to make sure there is nothing in your  \\nblind spots. \\nFasten your Seat Belt \\nFasten your seat belt before you start \\n(Fig. 4.9). Seat belts are for safety and not just for avoiding challans\\n. \\nSeat belts should be worn comfortable \\nenough to keep you in your seat if there is a collision. Put the shoulder strap over your shoulder, never under your arm. The lap belt should be put low over the hips, not over the stomach.

A person who is thrown out \\nof the vehicle during the collision has a \\nhigher chance of serious injury.\\nTurn on Headlights at Night and in Poor \\nLight Conditions \\nTurn on headlights around 30 minutes before sunset \\nand keep them on until 30 minutes after sunrise. Turn on your lights when fog or rain reduces your visibility to \\nless than 100 metres.   \\nKeep your headlights clean and get them adjusted \\nregularly so that they enable clearer vision while driving. In dim light, use your headlights, not parking lights. \\nParking lights are only for parking.   \\nHigh beams are banned in cities like Delhi, \\nChandigarh and other cities. You should not use high beams on roads. If you are travelling on a highway and using high beam headlights, switch to low beams within 150 metres of an incoming vehicle. Switch to your low beams when you are less than 60 metres behind  \\nanother vehicle.
